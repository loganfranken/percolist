# Percolist

This is a sample application created for an
[upcoming talk](http://west16.highedweb.org/schedule/open-source/)
I'm giving at [HighEdWeb West 2016](http://west16.highedweb.org/).

The application is simple: it provides a list of coffee shops nearby for the
user to try. The application lists 10 different shops and the user can press a
button to "check in" at each one.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how modern application are built
using a variety of useful open-source tools and libraries. This is in contrast
to the higher education world, where systems are often either built entirely
from the ground up or purchased from a vendor.

How would the landscape of higher education system development change if we
could share functionality across systems? Across institutions?
